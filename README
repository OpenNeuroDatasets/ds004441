Diffusion MRI data acquired on a cohort of rats with intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ) for Alzheimer's disease-like pathology, and a cohort of controls (sham injection). 
Aim: to investigate the changes in brain microstructure during pathology progression, in a preclinical setting. Animals underwent scanning session at four time-points: 2, 6, 13 and 21 weeks (ses-1,2,3 and 4) after injection.
Diffusion MRI data include 3 b-values up to b=2000 s/mm^2 and are suitable for DKI analysis and any version of the Standard Model of diffusion in white matter. 
Some rats are missing data from the last timepoint. Data were acquired across two scanner consoles, with an initial cohort acquired on a Varian console and a second cohort acquired on a Bruker console (rats with ID from 5541 to 5548). This information is available in the json file of each dataset.
